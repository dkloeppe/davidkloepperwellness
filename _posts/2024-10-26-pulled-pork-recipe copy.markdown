   Rinse the pork and pat it dry. Salt generously, then cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (overnight for deeper flavor). Meanwhile, chop the onion.

2. **Cook**:  
   Place the pork, chopped onion, and BBQ sauce into your Crock Pot. Set it to **Low** and cook for **8 hours** until tender and easily shredded.

### Tips:
- **Optional Seasoning**: Try adding a pinch of smoked paprika or garlic powder to elevate the flavor. I had actually dry brined my pork picnic with salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder.
