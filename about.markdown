Welcome to my Health and Fitness platform. My goal is to improve my physical and mental fitness! In order to do that, I'm going to workout daily, eat well, and get enough sleep every night. Thank you for checking out my content. Here you will find recipes, workouts, and motivational videos. Stay strong! 💪

My name is David Kloepper, and I started a YouTube channel (@DavidKloepperWellness)!  I have several fitness goals: I want to do a handstand pushup, I want to run an ultra-marathon, and I want to have a stronger body and mind! Right now, my daily workout consists of 100 pushups, 100 situps, 100 squats, and a 10K run! 🏃
